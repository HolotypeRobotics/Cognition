# Cognition for ROS2
ROS2 node for advanced bio-inspired robotic behavior.
# Application
The intention is to have this node run on a server computer while receiving sensory data from ROS2 Node on Arduino based boards, and responding with motor control signals.
# Learning Methods
This ROS2 node uses on-line learning methods based on [HTM theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3yXMgtrZmDqhsFQzwUC9V8MeeVOQ7eZ9), and cortical processing.
# Action Generation
Action generation is based on a neural network model of the [basal ganglia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxvep2Y8ShI) It produces internal ideas that are influenced, and decided upon by programmable factors.
