# Cognition Library
A modular framework designed to facilitate the development, configuration, and management of behavior based agents, offering tools for building, customizing, and orchestrating cognitive functionalities within robotic systems.
# Learning Methods
This uses a mixture of on-line learning methods based on [HTM theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3yXMgtrZmDqhsFQzwUC9V8MeeVOQ7eZ9), Q-Learning, and cortical processing.
# Action Generation
Action generation is based on a neural network model of the [basal ganglia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxvep2Y8ShI) It produces internal ideas that are influenced, and decided upon by programmable factors.

# Project Structure
## algorithms 
    Contains main driver, and utility code.
## networks
    Contains neural network models used in the project.
### blocks
    Each block is like a group of connections between regions to preform a specific function.
        In neuroscience this would be called a neural circuit.
